# How to configure your portfolio using AWS

This is a demo project which accompanies the article at https://medium.com/@dfernaro/the-art-of-efficient-product-catalog-unveiling-the-benefits-of-cdk-aws-service-catalog-42c09b4ae65c.

Please, make sure that you update the file `bin/portfolio.ts` which contains the AWS account and region.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

- `npm run build` compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
- `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
